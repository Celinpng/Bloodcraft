`0.9.0`
- Started keeping changelog
- removed weapon visual expertise tracking thing, was proving too difficult to manage and avoid buggy behavior. added command for players to restore weapon levels to what they should be
- VBloods, summoners and units that transform (not werewolves quite yet but Terah seemed okay) added to unlock pool and should mostly be behaving (including Cassius and his dumb sword). added configurable ban list
- using a waygate with familiar out will dismiss it, still have to use waygate again to teleport until I figure out how to do that in one go
- classes have configurable spells and blood buffs, tried to make okay defaults but C# is turning my brain into mush and decisions are hard so no promises. use .help liberally and read over the new config options as needed until I get the chance to update the readme
- class blood buffs always provide max benefits and are applied at MaxPlayerLevel/#buffs (level 22 if max level is 90 and there are 4 blood buffs for the first, then 44, and so on), can be mixed and matched as you like to create different feels for the classes. The effects from these don't appear to stack with the actual blood buff effects which keeps things somewhat balanced while allowing each class to have a persistent theme.
- class spells are unlocked at configured prestige levels, all classes have veil of shadows by default and the rest are unique to them. configurable but do note that many spells are kinda broken if casted by a player (dracula's blood ring lasts forever, as one example) so you'll want to test before adding/changing.
