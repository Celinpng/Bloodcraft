## Features

- **Weapon Expertise:** Enhances gameplay by introducing expertise in different weapon types and, in the case of unarmed, extra skills (unarmed also has stats as of second release). Experience for this is gained per kill based on equipped weapon. Stat choices are configurable from 1 to 5 per weapon. Resetting choices is free by default but can be made to cost items. Will be linking these to classes in some way hopefully sooner rather than later.
- **Player Professions:** Adds various professions, allowing players to specialize and gain benefits from leveling the professions they like most. Proficiency is gained per resource broken, item crafted, or succesful catch. Mining/woodcutting/harvesting provide bonus yields per resource harvest, fishing provide bonus fish every 20 levels based on the area fished in, alchemy enhances consumable duration and effects, and blacksmithing/enchanting/tailoring increases durability in armors/weapons crafted. Do note you only receive experience for crafting if you own the station/placed it if in a clan, plan on improving that and revamping these a bit in the future.
- **Experience Leveling:** Implements a leveling system to replace traditional gearscore and provide a greater sense of progression. Experience for this is gained per kill (should apply to all kills that can be linked back to the player) and can skip level 20 quest to track vbloods with .quickStart (.start). Still tuning this as needed but the config options should be there to support whatever kind of leveling experience you're looking to provide at this point (within reason :P). Experience sharing in clan or group has a max distance of 25f (4-5 floor lengths).
- **Blood Legacies:** Provides further stat customization for legacies (blood types) similar to expertise with a different set of stats. Experience for this is gained per feed kill/execute for equipped blood type. Blood quality increase option still exists as well if you prefer or would like to use both. Stat choices are configurable from 1 to 5 per blood. Resetting choices is free by default but can be made to cost items. Much like weapons, will be linking these to classes in some way hopefully sooner rather than later.
- **Prestige:** Prestige in leveling, expertise, and legacies! Each increment in leveling prestige will reduce experience gained for leveling by the rate reducer and increase expertise/legacy experience gains by the rate multiplier. Prestiging in expertise/legacies will increase their stat bonuses by the stat multiplier per increment and will reduce experience gains in that individual prestige by the rate reducer per increment. Plan on adding to this and adjusting as needed based on feedback but the foundation for a loop of continuous progression supported by various mod features and systems has been laid and will absolutely be expanded on in the future.
- **Familiars:** Every kill of a valid unit is a chance to unlock that unit as a familiar! They will level up, fight for you, and you can collect them all. Only one familiar can be summoned at a time. They can be toggled (called/dismissed) without fully unbinding them to quickly use waygates and perform other actions normally prohibited by having a follower (charmed human, for example). Each set can hold 10 and more sets will be created once the one being added to is full. You can choose the active set by name (default is FamiliarsList1, FamiliarsList2, etc) and the sets can be renamed. To summon a familiar from your current set, .lf to see the units available and use .bind #; to choose a different one, use .unbind, and if it gets weird or buggy at any point .resetfams can be used to clear your active familiar data and followerBuffer. All units have the same stats as usual, however their damage categories to unit types are heavily reduced at lower levels and will scale back up to normal as their level increases. Base health is 500 and will scale with their level too. More ways to customize them along the journey and at max level will be available in the future. Problem units are not able to be unlocked right now and include VBloods, MinionMasters (anything that summons other units), traders, carriages, and werewolves (these actually stay allied now when they transform now but the game changes their stats back, will revisit in the future along with phase changing units like VBloods when able).
