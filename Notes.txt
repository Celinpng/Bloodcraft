V RISING NOTES

Teams:
The UnitTeam entity is global for the units that use it unlike PlayerTeam entities of which each player has a unique one. Changing TeamData on the UnitTeam entity will apply to ALL of those units.
Oddly enough, they will be allied with the player to some degree as well (at least that was the case using a value of 1337, changing it back to 2 resulted in normal behaviour again). You can
purposefully create mismatches between the value for Team on players/units and the value on their team entity TeamData which has odd results; the former seems to handle general aggression/aggroability and the latter seems to handle being able to revive/ability collision/etc.
